# FlyFish #

## Version: `v1.0-alpha` ##

A proper Readme, and other documentation, will be created some time in the future. For now, this project is in the alpha stages.
You can manually take the fish script files for the main and right prompt functions and put them in your fish shell's functions
folder within the config folder *(typically `~/.config/fish/functions/`)* and rename them respectively: `fish_prompt.fish` and
`fish_right_prompt.fish`. Eventually, there will be the ability to automatically install the project using a script.
